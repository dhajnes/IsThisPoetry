## Description

Welcome. Have you ever wanted to just plug in your google drive and then download all of the files, which classify
as poetry? Haha, yes? Then you are at the right place!
* First, check out how to Set-Up your preexisting drive for the API communication here: `https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python`
  * Also includes the original test file used for my project
* Then proceed to login to the Google Cloud Platform console: `https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started`
* I really encourage you to check the official Google Drive API v3 Introduction, in the Guides subsection.
Here, an example on how to download files through API: `https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-downloads`

> In this project you will find: Working with the Google API v3, listing files, downloading files, traversing text files
and finally rendering them as .pdf
